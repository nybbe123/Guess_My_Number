# Guess my number mini game
## Mini project where I got the chance to train my programming and problemsolving skills.
### The game generates a random number and your objective is to guess what the number is. The random number is between 1 - 20 and you have 15 chances to guess the correct number. For every wrong guess you lose one point. The points that are left when you guess right will be transfered to your highscores.
